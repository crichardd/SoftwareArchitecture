# R-Corp Fresh Air Service Design Kata

## Objective:
Engage in a discussion and design exercise focusing on analyzing the problem context, understanding the requirements, and crafting a preliminary design of the involved entities and their interactions.

Important Note: Pay close attention to the details provided.

## Context:
Welcome to R-Corp, a pioneering company in the online retail of bottled fresh air.

We are tasked with reengineering our software system from the ground up. A critical starting point for our redesign efforts is the customer component, the core source of our revenue.

## Requirements:

Customers must have the capability to register online using their email as a username, with their full name also recorded.
Marketing personnel should be able to reach out to customers who have yet to make a purchase, using email or telephone, to promote our new products.
It is essential for customers to be able to input their postal address for home product delivery. Additionally, should we cater to business clients in the future, the system should accommodate the registration of a billing address.
We maintain a collaborative arrangement with local post offices, allowing customers the option to have their packages delivered there for later collection. This facility should be integrated into the service.

## Task:
Assist us in formulating a design that meets these requirements.
